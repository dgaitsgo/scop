	- match_extension_to_enum -> Should be more general to accept an array of strings and expected values
	- match is too greedy (e.g. would match ".geomXXX")

main

	1. Documentation
	2. Defensive coding
		a. custom assert
			i. for error handling
			ii. for abotss
		b. persistence check
	3. Error handling
		c. logs : log(char *message, &adress, __FILE__, __LINE__);
		I should be able to look at an error and
			Know where it happened
			What was the value, but how to keep types?
